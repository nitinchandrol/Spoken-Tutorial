We have used 2 classifiers SVM and KNN.
To start run run.sh script, it already contain trained classifier so no need of training, if u want to train again, comment out line in run.sh and run again to execute main.py
pyAudioAnalysis contain other lower level files for audioAnalysis, feature extraction and trainAndTest etc. It also contains data folder which further contains training and testing audio folders

NOTE: I have removed the data folder for now as, file size being in GB, it could not be submitted by moodle , which has 50 MB limit.
